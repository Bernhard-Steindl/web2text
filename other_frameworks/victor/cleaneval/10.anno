<p><span id="victor_an43" class="victor_paragraph">From: "Ragnar Redbeard"</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an44" class="victor_paragraph">It has been suggested in this newsgroup (alt.christianity) in response to my question regarding the origin of 666 that the number 666 has its roots in numerology. This is the school of thought that agree with. The number 666 has its origins in ancient numerology / astrology, and is connected to what are called "magic squares". The ancients devised a scheme of numbers arranged in squares and ordered in such a way that by adding each row and column, one would reach the same total each time. 666 comes from the square associated with the Sun, which is made up of every number from 1 to 36. The sum of all numbers from 1 to 36 is of course, 666. Surrounding the Sun Square are the 12 divisibles of 666 which are attached to the 12 signs of the Zodiac.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an45" class="victor_list">666 = Pisces
</span><br /><span id="victor_an46" class="victor_list">333 = Aquarius
</span><br /><span id="victor_an47" class="victor_list">222 = Capricorn
</span><br /><span id="victor_an48" class="victor_list">111 = Sagitaurus
</span><br /><span id="victor_an49" class="victor_list">74 = Scorpio
</span><br /><span id="victor_an50" class="victor_list">37 = Libra
</span><br /><span id="victor_an51" class="victor_list">18 = Virgo
</span><br /><span id="victor_an52" class="victor_list">9 = Leo
</span><br /><span id="victor_an53" class="victor_list">6 = Cancer
</span><br /><span id="victor_an54" class="victor_list">3 = Gemini
</span><br /><span id="victor_an55" class="victor_list">2 = Taurus
</span><br /><span id="victor_an56" class="victor_list">1 = Aries</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an57" class="victor_paragraph">Here is what the Sun Square looks like:</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an58" class="victor_list">6 32 3 34 35 1
</span><br /><span id="victor_an59" class="victor_list">7 11 27 28 8 30
</span><br /><span id="victor_an60" class="victor_list">19 14 16 15 23 24
</span><br /><span id="victor_an61" class="victor_list">18 20 22 21 17 13
</span><br /><span id="victor_an62" class="victor_list">25 29 10 9 26 12
</span><br /><span id="victor_an63" class="victor_list">36 5 33 4 2 31</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an64" class="victor_paragraph">The factors of 666 are 666, 333, 222, 111, 74, 37, 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, and 1. They are attached to the Zodiac signs as follows:</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an65" class="victor_paragraph">So, each of the six rows has a total of 111 (6 rows x 111 = 666). Each of the 6 columns also has a total of 111.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an66" class="victor_paragraph">The Sun Square contains 9 squares and rectangles whose corners total 74 ( 9 X 74 = 666 ) One example is "6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74"</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an67" class="victor_paragraph">For those who practiced numerology / astrology, the numbers 666 and 74 were considered 'holy' numbers, associated with the Sun, which they revered. Numerology / Astrology (from now on referred to as Hermetica) also became a recurring phenomenon in the bible, particularely the KJV. Many of the numbers which are sacred to Hermetica are found to be recurring throughout the KJV, 666 being the most obvious.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an68" class="victor_paragraph">The famous reference to 666 is found in revelation, but another exists in 1 Kings 10:14 where Solomon takes 666 talents of gold from neighboring kingdoms. Solomon is one of the more important examples of this biblically coded wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an69" class="victor_paragraph">Solomon is basically the figure head of the 12 tribes of Israel during his reign as king. Solomon represents the Sun and the Sun Square and the 12 tribes of Israel are the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The 666 clue found in 1 Kings is one hint - another is the name Solomon. "Sol" is the Latin word for the Sun, "Om" is the Hindi word for the Sun, and "On" is the Egyptian word for the Sun.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an70" class="victor_paragraph">While 666 is the most famous reference to the practice of Numerology found in the bible, there are many others which are more subtle. First a quick point regarding history:</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an71" class="victor_paragraph">In approximately 325 A.D. Emperor Constantine declared Christianity to be the official religion of the Roman Empire. His reasons are the topic of another discussion, but for better or worse it is a fact. For the next 1500 years, all other religions or philosophies were ruthlessly purged from the Roman Empire, to the point of knowledge of many ancient religions becoming extinct. The Ancients, realizing that practicing Hermetica (Numerology / Astrology) meant a visit to the torture chamber, did what anyone in their position would do - they hid their knowledge. The were fortunate in the fact that they were practically the only ones with any sort of education, and thus were trusted to read, write, and interpret for Rome. Fast forward to somewhere in the 1600's when King James decided that the bible should be available in English and commissioned a group of scholars including Francis Bacon* to oversee the translation of the bible from Hebrew &amp; Latin to English. Francis Bacon was a member of the chain of minds that sprang from the Ancient Philosophers and he constructed the KJV in such a way that the knowledge they possessed may be preserved. All one has to do is decipher it.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an72" class="victor_paragraph">Now, with that in mind, we can look at the bible and understand why it is arranged the way it is. If someone was to write a code without leaving any sort of decoding manual, it stands to reason that the means of decoding his work would have to be included in his work. The first step to deciphering this code would be to look for extremes. Take for example, Psalm 117. It sits at the exact center of the bible (in traditional order) and is the shortest chapter in the bible. As such, it almost jumps out and screams "Hey, look at me!" Psalms 117 has exactly 33 words. By no coincidence there are 33 years in the life of Christ, and 33 generations from Adam to David.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an73" class="victor_paragraph">*There are those who believe that it was Francis Bacon who wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare. Here is a little tidbit suggestive of this theory. Count 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible. You will find that it is Psalm 46. Count 46 words into that chapter and find that the 46th word is "Shake". Count 46 words backwards from the end of that chapter and find that the 46th word is "spear". The mathematical laws of probability eliminate the "coincidence" theory, and we conclude that with this method of "counting the bible" rather than reading the bible we are on the right track.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an74" class="victor_paragraph">Due to a period of over one thousand years in which anything other than Church approved subject matter was relentlessly purged, intimate knowledge of pre-Christian religious practices (particularely those related to Numerology) is scarce. Some rudimentary information still remains, such as the names and fables associated with the Pagan lore, along with some fundamental Numerology / Astrology concepts. Many are familiar with the tales of Thor, Odin (Wotan, Woden), Zues, and the whole pantheon of gods and goddesses. The horoscopic information that exists in today's New Age circles consists mainly of simple clairvoyance and "love spells". Many New Age occultists use the principles of Gematria and such to discover "their" number, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an75" class="victor_paragraph">Ancient 'magicians' used 7 unique number squares as the basis for their wisdom. Each square was arranged in such a way that the total of any column or row was the same. Each of the seven 'magic' squares was also assigned a planetary value. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, and the Sun, are all associated with a specific square. It is the Sun Square that is most relevent to bible coding. The sun square is the 4th of the 7 magic squares and consists of every number from 1 to 36, arranged in six rows and six columns. Each of the six rows adds up to 111 and each of the six columns adds to 111. It is from the Magic Square of the Sun that the infamous number 666 originates. 6 columns X 111 = 666. 6 rows X 111 = 666. All of the numbers 1 through 36 total 666. There are a total of 3 squares and 6 rectangles within the Sun Square, each of which adds to 74, and are listed below. 9 rectangles &amp; squares X 74 = 666.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an76" class="victor_list">6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an77" class="victor_list">11 + 8 + 26 + 29 = 74</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an78" class="victor_list">16 + 15 + 21 + 22 = 74</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an79" class="victor_list">7 + 3 + 12 + 25 = 74</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an80" class="victor_list">19 + 24 + 13 + 18 = 74</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an81" class="victor_list">32 + 35 + 2 + 5 = 74</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an82" class="victor_list">3 + 34 + 4 + 33 = 74</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an83" class="victor_list">14 + 23 + 17 + 20 = 74</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an84" class="victor_list">27 + 28 + 9 + 10 = 74</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an85" class="victor_paragraph">The numbers to keep track of here are 9, 74, and 666, as they will turn up elsewhere later.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an86" class="victor_paragraph">Very possibly, the other squares contain number patterns that can be found in the bible, but our focus will remain with the Sun Square. The number 666 has 12 divisibles, and these divisibles are associated with the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The Sun Square and its 12 divisibles (or 12 signs of the Zodiac) serve to form a theme which was to become common in many later religions. Odin had 12 chief priests, Solomon had 12 tribes of Israel, and Jesus had 12 disciples. The 1 + 12 phenomenon is found in other areas as well. In U.S. courts, there is a Judge, and twelve jurors. Anglo-Saxon folklore tells of King Arthur and twelve Knights of the Round Table. Upon reflection this should be an obvious analogue as King Arthur and the Round Table represent the Sun and the Sun Square, and the 12 Knights represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an87" class="victor_paragraph">It should be clear that the chances of these religions and folklore sharing the 1 + 12 theme being a coincidence is gradually falling. Furthermore, since the 1 + 12 theme appears primarily in Western religions, it is likely that they originate from one source. This source has been given many names throughout the centuries and usually takes the form of secret societies. At one point it was discovered that certain sounds affected the subconcious mind, and it was long known that the human animal is a herd animal. Perceptive people realized that the two should be mixed very carefully. Some sound arrangements had a soothing effect, while some had an angering effect, or a saddening effect. Ancient temples were often constructed in such a way that the songs sung during services would have a maximum effect on the mass. Certain notes can shatter glass, or render humans unconcious, and it was this power that these societies intended to conceal. Unscrupulous people could easily use this knowledge to the detriment of society. When languages were constructed, their vowels and consonants were assigned numerical values. The study of this alphabetic / numerical association is called Gematria, and Gematria is used to assign numbers to sounds (words, phrases, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an88" class="victor_paragraph">Deities, or important figures in mythology and religion are constructed in accordance with the principles outlined above. English Gematria assigns the value of "1" to the letter "A", and "2" to the letter "B", etc. With this in mind, look at the word "Jesus":</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an89" class="victor_paragraph">J E S U S</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an90" class="victor_paragraph">10 + 5 + 19 + 21 + 19 = 74</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an91" class="victor_paragraph">Let it also be known that the word Jesus in Greek adds to "888" in Greek Gematria. Greek Gematria increases by a factor of 10 each 8 characters, and the 24th characther has a value of 800. Jesus is referred to as being the offspring of David throughout the bible, and that referrence is due to the fact that the numerical value of Jesus can be found in the Mars Square. If the Star of David is drawn in the Mars Square, and the numbers in the Mars Square are reduced to single digits, we observe the following phenomenon:</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an92" class="victor_list">2 6 7 2 3</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an93" class="victor_list">4 3 7 8 7</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an94" class="victor_list">8 5 4 3 9</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an95" class="victor_list">1 9 1 5 4</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an96" class="victor_list">5 6 1 2 6</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an97" class="victor_paragraph">After drawing the Star of David inside this square, we see that the points on the two triangles collect the numbers in such a way that each triangle has a value of 741. The first triangle has the tip at the number '7' in the first row, and its two base points sit at 4 and 1, if we travel clockwise. The inverted triangle has its upper right point at the 7 in the last column, and travels across the column to arrive at the 4 in the first column, and finally the 1 at the tip. Inside the hexagram that the center of the Star forms, we see the number 741 travel down the vertical axis and the number 543 travel across the horizontal axis. 741 + 147 = 888 and 543 + 345 = 888. This is why Jesus is referred to as a branch of David.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an98" class="victor_paragraph">Note that the word "Joshua" adds to "74" in the same way Jesus does, and incidentally so does the word "occult".</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an99" class="victor_paragraph">Even though it is thought to be common knowledge that a man named "Shakespeare" wrote the collection of classic plays, an interesting 'coincidence' is found by employing the coding concepts used by Francis Bacon (who supervised the writing of the KJV). If we count 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible, we arrive at Psalm 46. Excluding the mysterious word "selah" (which appears 74 times throughout the KJV) we count 46 words from the beginning of the chapter and find the 46th word to be "shake". The 46th word from the end of the chapter is "spear". This is coincidental to the theory held by some that Francis Bacon wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an100" class="victor_paragraph">When constructing a code that is designed to be deciphered without a 'decoder's guide' a cryptographer will use extremes as pointers to show us the structure of the code. Tools such as longest, shortest, and repetition serve to draw attention. In keeping with this theory, we notice that the shortest chapter in the bible, Psalm 117, is also placed in the exact center. It contains exactly 33 words, which by no coincidence is the number of years in the life of Christ, the number of generations from Adam to David, and the number of degrees in Freemasonry.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an101" class="victor_paragraph">On counting sets of 33 chapters from the beginning of the bible we find that the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 6. 9 sets of 33 chapters backwards from Psalm 117, we find that the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 7. The chapters 1 Kings 6 and 1 Kings 7 detail the construction of Solomon's Temple. The Temple is begun in 1 Kings 6, and construction ends in 1 Kings 7.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an102" class="victor_paragraph">Due to the fact that the word "temple" is often associated with perfected man, and wisdom, a great deal of coding can be found within the biblical concept of Solomon. The word "Solomon" serves a dual purpose in the coding of the bible. The word "Sol" is Latin for "sun", the word "Om" is Hindi for "sun" and the word "On" is Egyptian for "sun". Also, the vowel "o" is symmetrically placed throughout the word 3 times. Note that "o" is the 15th letter in the alphabet:</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an103" class="victor_list">O O O</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an104" class="victor_list">15 15 15</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an105" class="victor_list">1 + 5 1 + 5 1 + 5 = 666</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an106" class="victor_paragraph">Even when presented with information such as this, the Christians will grow stronger in their proclaimations that the practice of Numerology is evil. Sometimes it will be suggested that perhaps this coding was designed by the devil to discredit the 'truth' of Christianity. Nonetheless Solomon was designed to code 666 and the Sun Square, and makes references to the 'temple', all of which are concepts borrowed from the ancient Occult.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an107" class="victor_paragraph">Not unlike the 1 + 12 theme, the recurrence of the number "7" in religion and mythology is significant. The Seven Seals of Revelation is a reference to the 7 magic Squares, as are other references to 7 in the bible:</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an108" class="victor_paragraph">Seven horns and seven eyes are the seven spirits of God (Rev 5:6), Seven lamps of fire which are the seven spirits of God (Rev 4:5) are all references to the 7 magic squares.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an109" class="victor_paragraph">Sometimes methods other than Gematria and Numerological coding are used, and in Revelation 2:17 we discover coded in that verse the belief system held by Francis Bacon and the Initiates who wrote the King James Bible. Revelation 2:17 reads</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an110" class="victor_paragraph">"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it"</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an111" class="victor_paragraph">In this case, the passage points to a new name written in 'a white stone'. If one were to unscramble the words 'a white stone' we will get 'thee is wotan'. Remember Wotan is a deity in the pantheon known as Asatru, and sometimes goes by the name 'Woden' or 'Odin'. The odds on that being a coincidence simply cannot be fathomed.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an112" class="victor_paragraph">Other than the passages to be unscrambled ("a white stone" - "thee is wotan") and the subtle references to the magic squares, most of the words in the bible are 'filler', which serve no real interpretive purpose. The bible is so full of contradictions and pure nonsense that it only stands to reason that it was not meant to be read, but counted. Other theories suggest that the King James bible was written as a time-bomb designed to destroy Christianity. Others suggest that Christianity in general was designed to destroy the West, and that the KJV was designed to warn us and was coded to preserve ancient wisdom. Both theories fit the facts outlined above, but it is doubtful that the whole story will ever be known.</span></p>
<p><span id="victor_an113" class="victor_paragraph">Now that the coding system has been discovered, the dominoes will begin to fall. Given enough time, we can no doubt unravel all of the wisdom encoded into the KJV and discover the knowledge known only by a few, and persecuted by religious tyrants for hundreds of years. This essay outlined a few pointers and coding principles and the reader is encouraged to discover more. Remember, count the bible, don't read it!</span></p>
